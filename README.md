MATLAB version 2014b (System: Intel Core i5-7200U @ 2.5GHz, 64-bit, 8 GB RAM) 

## Code
	4 images are provided. One is used for wiener filter calculation and the filter is tested on other three images.

	wienerFilter.m is the MATLAB file. Open it and run it.

	Initially the code will calculate the wiener filter using input image and show the original,noisy and restored image with PSNR and MMSE values of noisy and restored image.

	Then it will ask to enter the location of input image. Enter 'X.jpg' (X = 1,2,3), then enter gaussian blur standard deviation (2,3 etc)
	and finally enter standard deviation of noise (50,60 etc). Again it will show the original,noisy and restored image with PSNR and MMSE values of noisy and restored image.

	After that it prompts to exit, Enter 'y' to exit.
